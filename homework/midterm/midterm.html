In the second half of the PANAMERA's body, there is no classic drop-shaped passenger compartment of the 911. Instead, it has a length of 4,970 mm and a width of 1931 mm. With a height of just 1418 mm, the Porsche Panamera maintains the classic element of the low center of gravity of the 911.</p>

Porsche has a fixed logic for vehicle styling, such as the front fenders on both sides being slightly above the hood and connected by a smooth curve. The air intake on the front of the front is concentrated below the center line. The side of the body has a smooth waistline, and the side windows are slightly narrower than the waistline. The smooth connection between the roof and the rear is complemented by a moderately sized rear window. The rear end minimizes unnecessary extra-embellishment. The downforce required for high-speed driving is designed by the aerodynamic design of the underbody and electric The lifting tail is responsible.</p>
