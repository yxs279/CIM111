    <p>

In folklore, during the Spring Festival, a wild animal called Nian, also called "Xi", appears in the winter in the wild. New Year's Eve appears once a year. This day is called "New Year's Eve" (the New Year's Eve), and the New Year's Eve is called "New Year's Eve" (New Year's Eve). New Year's Eve "Xi" is very fierce. In the middle of the night, he walked away from home and ate people. In order to avoid the New Year, the ancestors of Yan and Huang reunited together and sat together to resist the New Year's beast.
<br>
<br>
Due to the annual beasts appearing once a year, Yan Huang's ancestors worked out the knack of struggle in countless struggles. Although the young beasts are fierce, they are afraid of red, fire, and loud noises. Therefore, every family posted a red spring couplet at the door, lit a bonfire at the door, set off firecrackers, and Nianju saw a red couplet on the door of the house, a red fire ignited at the door, and firecrackers thundered. They would also say goodbye to the elders, and they would drive away Beast of the year.

      <p>The mainland of China is vast, and the customs of the festivals vary from place to place. Nationally, the atmosphere of the Chinese New Year has started to grow from the Laba Festival to the end of the Lantern Festival. In Fuzhou, the festival ends after the 29th festival of the 9th day of the first month.</p>

  <p>  Even children who are really unable to return home will report a message of safety to the family on New Year's Eve, so that the family will not worry about the Spring Festival. In mainland China, a large number of calls during the Spring Festival blocked the national communications network, and mass text messaging has become a "poison"; in recent years, with the growing popularity of QQ and WeChat and the construction of the country's communications infrastructure, "video greetings", " "Internet red envelopes" have gradually become the main way of worshiping the New Year.

There are many religions in China, especially the atmosphere of folk beliefs that integrate Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism and Buddhism. During the Spring Festival, Buddhist temples in various places hold temple fairs; there are also people who volunteer to pray to Buddhist temples, Taoist temples, temples, churches, mosques, ancestral grave tablets, and martyr monuments to pray for New Year's peace.</p>

<p>  Various circles in China will also issue various souvenirs to commemorate the Spring Festival. Every year before the Spring Festival, the People's Bank of China will start the exchange of Lunar New Year commemorative coins; various shopping malls and online platforms will also issue various coupons to promote consumption.

The specific annual customs in North and South China are quite different, as listed below. As for the specific annual customs, each province, county, village, and even family is not the same, so it is impossible to enumerate.
